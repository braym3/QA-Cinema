```
3. Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to open up a terminal in both the ```final_project``` and ```final_project-back-end folders``` and run ```npm i``` to install the required node modules.
4. Once the node modules have been installed, you can run the website by executing ```npm start``` in both the folders mentioned above. This will start the back end running at port 4494 and the front end at port 3000, as well as opening the website in your preferred browser. You can now use navigate through the website and interact with the various pages.

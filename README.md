2. You can then clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command
```
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/QA-Cinema.git
```
3. Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to open up a terminal in both the ```final_project``` and ```final_project-back-end folders``` and run ```npm i``` to install the required node modules.
4. Once the node modules have been installed, you can run the website by executing ```npm start``` in both the folders mentioned above. This will start the back end running at port 4494 and the front end at port 3000, as well as opening the website in your preferred browser. You can now use navigate through the website and interact with the various pages.

# Importing and running the QACinemas website

For testing our React application, we used the Mocha, Chai, Selenium and Istanbul libraries. Mocha and Chai were used to write the tests for the back end, with Istanbul used to test the coverage. 

*** Insert picture of coverage here ***

Our goal was to acheive the industry standard of 80% coverage for both parts of the application. With the back end we surpassed this, achieving a total coverage of <INSERT-COVERAGE-HERE>. Our front end testing <INSERT-DETAILS-HERE>
  
To run the tests for the back end execute ```npm run coverage``` in the final_project-back-end terminal. You will see the test diagram displayed above.
  
To run the front end tests run ``` <WHATEVER-THE-COMMAND-IS>``` in the final_project terminal.
